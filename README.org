#+TITLE: Preprocessor

Preprocessor is a library to preprocess cpp (a task not usually done by parsing
libraries like =haskell-src-exts=).

It has a very simple API, consituted of two functions:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
getExposedModulesPath :: FilePath -> IO [FilePath]
#+END_SRC
which, given the path of the =.cabal= file, will return the paths of all the
exposed files, and

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
preprocessFile :: FilePath -> IO String
#+END_SRC
which, given the path of a file, should return the content of the files without
cpp (it tries to automatically find all the required information in the cabal
project).

The code is still in an alpha state, so please submit issues if you encounter
any problem! :)
